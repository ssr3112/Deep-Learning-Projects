We performed sentiment analysis by comparing the performance of three different Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures: the Simple RNN, the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), and the GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit).

The primary goal was to see how each model handles sequence data and long-term dependencies in text for binary classification.
